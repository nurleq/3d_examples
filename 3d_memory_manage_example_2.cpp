/*
Here's an example of a C++ program that demonstrates more complex memory management scenarios, including:

1.  **Dynamic memory allocation**: Creating and managing objects with dynamic memory allocation using `new` and
`delete`.
2.  **Smart pointers with shared ownership**: Using multiple smart pointers to share ownership of the same
object, demonstrating how to avoid duplicate deletion.
3.  **Stack-based vs. heap-based memory allocation**: Showing how to allocate memory on the stack versus the
heap using `std::array` and `std::vector`.
4.  **Memory fragmentation prevention**: Implementing a simple memory management algorithm that prevents memory
fragmentation in a dynamic memory allocation system.

In this example, we've demonstrated various memory management techniques in C++, including dynamic memory
allocation using `new` and `delete`, smart pointers with shared ownership, stack-based vs. heap-based memory
allocation using `std::array` and `std::vector`, and a simple memory fragmentation prevention algorithm.

Please note that the above code is simplified for illustration purposes only and should not be used in
production without proper modifications and optimizations to suit your specific use case.
