/*
In this example, we load an image file into a buffer using `loadImage()`. We then create a texture object that
references the loaded image data buffer. In the main loop, we update the image data every 10 frames using
`updateImageData()`, which loads a new image from file and updates the texture object to reference it.

Note that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific use case. For
example, you may want to add error checking or handling for cases where the image loading fails.

>>> how can i use particle and energy methods in c++ when 3d modeling, involving trellising bending stretching, repell... ing, and gravity.
Here's a general overview of how you could implement particle and energy methods in C++ for 3D modeling:

**Particle System:**

1. Define a `Particle` struct to hold the following information:
        * Position (x, y, z)
        * Velocity (dx, dy, dz)
        * Acceleration (ax, ay, az) - driven by forces (e.g., gravity, repulsion)
        * Mass
        * Color and texture (optional)
2. Create an array or vector of `Particle` objects to store the particles.
3. In your main loop:
        * Update particle positions based on their velocities (acceleration is not considered yet)
        * Apply forces to each particle (e.g., gravity, repulsion) by adding acceleration
        * Update particle velocities based on their accelerations
4. Optionally, you can add a collision detection system to handle interactions between particles.

**Energy Methods:**

1. Define an energy function that calculates the total potential and kinetic energy of the particle system.
2. In your main loop:
        * Calculate the new energy state by summing the potential and kinetic energies of all particles
        * Use numerical methods (e.g., Newton's method) to minimize or optimize the energy state
3. To minimize energy, you can use optimization algorithms such as:
        * Gradient Descent: iteratively update particle positions based on the gradient of the energy function
        * Simplex Optimization: use a simplex algorithm to find the minimum energy configuration

**Trellising:**

1. Define a `Node` struct to hold the following information:
        * Position (x, y, z)
        * Velocity (dx, dy, dz)
        * Angle of rotation around local axes
2. Create an array or vector of `Node` objects to store the nodes.
3. In your main loop:
        * Update node positions based on their velocities
        * Apply forces to each node (e.g., gravity) and update their accelerations
        * Rotate nodes around their local axes based on their angles of rotation

**Bending:**

1. Define a `Bone` struct to hold the following information:
        * Position (x, y, z)
        * Velocity (dx, dy, dz)
        * Angles of rotation around global axes (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw)
2. Create an array or vector of `Bone` objects to store the bones.
3. In your main loop:
        * Update bone positions based on their velocities
        * Apply forces to each bone (e.g., gravity) and update their accelerations
        * Rotate bones around global axes based on their angles of rotation

**Stretching:**

1. Define a `Segment` struct to hold the following information:
        * Position (x, y, z)
        * Velocity (dx, dy, dz)
2. Create an array or vector of `Segment` objects to store the segments.
3. In your main loop:
        * Update segment positions based on their velocities
        * Apply forces to each segment (e.g., gravity) and update their accelerations

**Repelling:**

1. Define a `Contact` struct to hold the following information:
        * Position (x, y, z)
        * Velocity (dx, dy, dz)
2. Create an array or vector of `Contact` objects to store the contacts.
3. In your main loop:
        * Update contact positions based on their velocities
        * Apply forces to each contact (e.g., repulsion) and update their accelerations

**Gravity:**

1. Define a `Force` struct to hold the following information:
        * Direction (x, y, z)
        * Magnitude
2. Create an array or vector of `Force` objects to store the forces.
3. In your main loop:
        * Update force directions based on gravity (e.g., acceleration due to gravity)
        * Apply forces to each particle and update their accelerations
